Integration Testing with Maven

* Overview

  If you already familiar with {{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven}} you
  know {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html}where to put your unit tests}}
  but unfortunately currently there does not exist a definition like
  this for integration tests. There are some suggestions poking around
  like <<<src/test/it>>>, but these are only rumors.

  In this guide we suggest to put them into the same directory structure
  like the unit tests which means in other words <<<src/test/java>>> and
  make them distinguishable by the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html#includes}naming conventions}}.

~~ Integration Tests have a more comprehensive character than unit tests.

  The execution of integration tests is handled by the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/}Maven Failsafe Plugin}}.

  * {{{./integration-test-example.html}in module integration test example}}

  * Simple integration test example (CLI Example in module)

  * separate module for integration tests.

  * IT example separate module...

  * Complex examples

  *** Integration test of a web app (war + tomcat?)

  * Plugin Development integration tests
